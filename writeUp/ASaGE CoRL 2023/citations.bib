  abstract      = {Experience replay lets online reinforcement learning agents remember and reuse experiences from the past. In prior work, experience transitions were uniformly sampled from a replay memory. However, this approach simply replays transitions at the same frequency that they were originally experienced, regardless of their significance. In this paper we develop a framework for prioritizing experience, so as to replay important transitions more frequently, and therefore learn more efficiently. We use prioritized experience replay in Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a reinforcement learning algorithm that achieved human-level performance across many Atari games. DQN with prioritized experience replay achieves a new state-of-the-art, outperforming DQN with uniform replay on 41 out of 49 games.},

  abstract      = {Experience replay is central to off-policy algorithms in deep reinforcement learning (RL), but there remain significant gaps in our understanding. We therefore present a systematic and extensive analysis of experience replay in Q-learning methods, focusing on two fundamental properties: the replay capacity and the ratio of learning updates to experience collected (replay ratio). Our additive and ablative studies upend conventional wisdom around experience replay -- greater capacity is found to substantially increase the performance of certain algorithms, while leaving others unaffected. Counterintuitively we show that theoretically ungrounded, uncorrected n-step returns are uniquely beneficial while other techniques confer limited benefit for sifting through larger memory. Separately, by directly controlling the replay ratio we contextualize previous observations in the literature and empirically measure its importance across a variety of deep RL algorithms. Finally, we conclude by testing a set of hypotheses on the nature of these performance benefits.},

  abstract      = {The popular Q-learning algorithm is known to overestimate action values under certain conditions. It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.},

  abstract      = {In recent years there have been many successes of using deep representations in reinforcement learning. Still, many of these applications use conventional architectures, such as convolutional networks, LSTMs, or auto-encoders. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture for model-free reinforcement learning. Our dueling network represents two separate estimators: one for the state value function and one for the state-dependent action advantage function. The main benefit of this factoring is to generalize learning across actions without imposing any change to the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm. Our results show that this architecture leads to better policy evaluation in the presence of many similar-valued actions. Moreover, the dueling architecture enables our RL agent to outperform the state-of-the-art on the Atari 2600 domain.},

  year          = {2021},
  month         = feb,
  abstract      = {As access to space and robotic autonomy capabilities move forward, there is simultaneously a growing interest in deploying large, complex space structures to provide new on-orbit capabilities. New space-borne observatories, large orbital outposts, and even futuristic on-orbit manufacturing will be enabled by robotic assembly of space structures using techniques like on-orbit additive manufacturing which can provide flexibility in constructing and even repairing complex hardware. However, the dynamics underlying the robotic assembler during manipulation may operate under inertial uncertainties. Thus, inertial estimation of the robot and the manipulated component system must be considered during structural assembly. The contribution of this work is to address both the motion planning and control for robotic assembly with consideration of the inertial estimation of the combined free-flying robotic assembler and additively manufactured component system. Specifically, the Linear Quadratic Regulator Rapidly-Exploring Randomized Trees (LQR-RRT*) and dynamically feasible path smoothing are used to obtain obstacle-free trajectories for the system. Further, model learning is incorporated explicitly into the planning stages via approximation of the continuous system and accompanying reward of performing safe, objective-oriented motion. Remaining uncertainty can then be dealt with using robust tube model predictive control. By obtaining controlled trajectories that consider both obstacle avoidance and learning of the inertial properties of the free-flyer and manipulated component system, the free-flyer rapidly considers and plans the construction of space structures with enhanced system knowledge. The approach naturally generalizes to repairing, refueling, and re-provisioning space structure components while providing optimal collision-free trajectories under e.g., inertial uncertainty.},

We propose a hierarchical algorithm for computing makespan-optimal solutions to the problem. The algorithm is evaluated on a set of randomly generated problem instances where robots must transport objects between stations in a "factory "grid world environment.
